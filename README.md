# Simon’s Task - Spatial Compatibility Experiment 🧠

This project implements a cognitive science experiment based on the Simon effect (Simon & Rudell, 1967), investigating how spatial stimulus-response compatibility affects reaction time.

## 🎯 Objective

To measure the difference in reaction time and accuracy between:
- **Congruent trials**: the word “LEFT” appears on the left side, requiring a left-hand response (key "Z")
- **Incongruent trials**: the word “RIGHT” appears on the left side, requiring a right-hand response (key "M")

## 🧪 Method

- 20-trial training session  
- 4 experimental blocks × 60 randomized trials (240 total)  
- Response times and accuracy measured with millisecond precision  
- Conditions randomized, jittered pause times between trials  
- Developed in collaboration with two other students at the Jagiellonian University

## 👩🏻‍💻 Cognitive focus

- Spatial S-R compatibility  
- Attention interference  
- Automated processing and executive control

## 🛠️ Tools

- Python  
- Custom logic + randomized trial generator  
- Designed for full-screen presentation & reaction logging
